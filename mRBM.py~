# a Restricted Boltzmann machine implemented as a weight matrix with state vector, activation energy vector, probability vector and draw from prob vector. State updating has fwd and bwd directions which update the hidden and input nodes respectively.

With off=-1, there is a penalty for anti-correlated nodes and a gain for correlated nodes (either on/on or off/off), whereas with off=0 there is only positive reinforcement for the on/on configuration and nothing for the other configurations.

As the model starts to overfit the average free energy of the validation data will rise relative to the average free energy of the training data and this gap represents the amount of overfitting.
